// A log with something in it, for anything that needs a screen that isn't empty.

// Where this fits: beside the checkers, not in js/. Nothing the app ships
// imports it — it exists so a render check and a browser triage look at the
// *same* populated state, instead of each inventing one that drifts from the
// other and from the real shape.
//
// Two attempts, a mock, a retro, four quiz answers, a design session and a
// running day clock: enough for every list, chart and empty-state branch to
// take its non-empty path.
