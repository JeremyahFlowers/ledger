// Draggable pane splitters for the session workspace.
//
// Where this fits: the workspace lays its panes out as a CSS grid whose column
// widths are fractions of the row. This module owns those fractions — the
// arithmetic of moving one, the clamping that stops a pane collapsing to
// nothing, and the persistence so a layout you set once survives the next
// session.
//
// Why it's a module and not a few lines in the view: the workspace has a hard
// rule that nothing may re-render while CodeMirror and the whiteboard are
// mounted, because rebuilding the markup destroys them and loses whatever was
// typed or drawn. So resizing has to work by writing styles onto live nodes,
// never by re-rendering — and that is exactly the kind of imperative DOM code
// that is easiest to get subtly wrong and hardest to test. The arithmetic is
// therefore pulled out as pure functions that can be pinned directly, and the
// DOM layer below them stays thin enough to read in one go.
