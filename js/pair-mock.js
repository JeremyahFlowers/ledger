// Two mediums in forty-five minutes: the pace a Meta coding round runs at.
//
// Where this fits: above session-view.js, which runs one problem at a time,
// and unchanged by it. A pair mock is two ordinary mock sessions sharing one
// budget: each is given whatever is left of the forty-five minutes, and this
// file decides what that is, which two problems, and whether the round would
// have passed.
//
// Why it is its own thing rather than a longer mock. The skill is not solving
// a medium; it is solving one in twenty minutes *and then another*, which is
// a different discipline — knowing when an approach is good enough to write,
// and not spending the second problem's time polishing the first. A single
// forty-five-minute mock cannot teach that, because it never runs short.
//
// The clock counts working time only. Each problem is reflected on while it is
// fresh, and that reflection does not come out of the second problem's time —
// less like the real round's hard switch, and honest about pace, which is the
// thing being measured.
