// The questions to ask before writing a line.
//
// Where this fits: a drill beside the pattern, component and fluency drills,
// read by the quiz page. It holds the prompts, the questions that matter for
// each, and the arithmetic of which kinds of question you habitually skip.
//
// Why it exists. Some interviewers — Google's are known for it — give a
// deliberately vague prompt and grade the questions as much as the code. "Find
// two numbers that add up to the target" hides five decisions: is the list
// sorted, numbers or indices, one pair or all, what if there is none, can an
// element pair with itself. Each changes the solution, and a candidate who
// starts coding without asking has chosen answers without noticing.
//
// So every question here carries what its answer *changes*. A list of
// questions to memorise is a checklist; a question paired with the design
// decision it settles is the habit being built. And they are grouped into
// kinds, because the useful feedback is not "you missed question four" but
// "you never ask about duplicates".

      { kind: "output", q: "How are ties broken?", changes: "A tie-break is a secondary sort key, which changes the heap's comparator." },
      { kind: "text", q: "Is it case-sensitive, and what counts as a word — punctuation, hyphens, apostrophes?", changes: "The tokeniser is half the solution, and \"Don't\" and \"dont\" must land in the same bucket or not on purpose." },

      { kind: "text", q: "Is it case-sensitive?", changes: "Whether 'A' and 'a' repeat each other decides what the window's map is keyed on." },
      { kind: "output", q: "The length, or the substring itself?", changes: "The substring needs the window's start kept at the best point, not just a running maximum." },

      { kind: "rules", q: "Does every step cost the same?", changes: "Equal costs: BFS. Different costs: Dijkstra. Negative costs: Bellman-Ford. The whole algorithm turns on this." },
      { kind: "output", q: "The length of the path, or the path itself?", changes: "The path needs parent pointers kept during the search." },

      { kind: "structure", q: "Is it sorted?", changes: "Sorted means duplicates are adjacent, and no extra memory is needed at all." },
      { kind: "output", q: "Which copy survives — the first or the last?", changes: "It changes which one you skip, and it matters as soon as the elements carry data." },

      { kind: "structure", q: "Do the timestamps arrive in order?", changes: "In order, old ones fall off the front of a queue. Out of order, you need buckets or a sorted structure." },
      { kind: "size", q: "How many requests a second at the peak?", changes: "Thousands a second rules out keeping one entry per request." },
      { kind: "rules", q: "One server, or many?", changes: "Many means the counts have to be combined, and their clocks will disagree." },

      { kind: "structure", q: "May I reorder the array?", changes: "Quickselect works in place and reorders it; if that is not allowed, a heap or a copy." },
      { kind: "size", q: "How long is the list, and what range are the values in?", changes: "A small value range allows counting instead of comparing." },

    questions: [
      { kind: "text", q: "Should spaces and punctuation be ignored?", changes: "\"A man, a plan...\" is only a palindrome if they are, and skipping them is the two-pointer loop's inner while." },
      { kind: "text", q: "Is it case-insensitive?", changes: "Lower-case as you compare, rather than building a lower-cased copy." },
      { kind: "text", q: "Which characters count as letters — ASCII only, or accented and non-Latin ones too?", changes: "isalnum means different things in different languages, and in Unicode." },
      { kind: "empty", q: "Is an empty string a palindrome?", changes: "Most definitions say yes. Saying it out loud is the point." },
