// Checkpointing an in-progress session, so closing the tab doesn't throw the
// work away.
//
// Where this fits: js/views.js owns the live `session` object and calls
// checkpoint() whenever something worth keeping changes. On boot, app.js asks
// for restore() before the first render, so a reload lands back in the
// workspace rather than on the dashboard.
//
// Why it exists: `session` was module state and nothing else. A refresh, a
// followed link, or a phone evicting a background tab discarded the timer, the
// typed code, the whiteboard and the pasted statement, with no warning and no
// way back. The app already asks people to work in a tab for an hour; it has
// to survive that hour.
//
// What is *not* kept here: anything already in the synced state. This holds
// only what exists between starting a problem and saving it, which is exactly
// the window where a crash costs something unrecoverable.

const KEY = "ledger.session";

// Past this, a restored session is almost certainly abandoned rather than
// interrupted, and silently resuming it would put a stale problem in front of
// someone who has moved on.

 * start forward — the elapsed time on screen is unchanged by the reload, which
 * is what someone who reloaded would expect to see.
