// The first run.
//
// Where this fits: shown once, after the GitHub connection succeeds and before
// the dashboard, and never again unless asked for from Settings.
//
// Why it exists: a new account lands on a dashboard holding a plant, a budget
// ring, a recommendation and a 23-pattern taxonomy, with no indication what
// any of it is for. The reasoning behind every one of those is written down —
// in source comments and a changelog, where nobody looks. An app whose whole
// argument is "don't grind, practise deliberately" has to make that argument
// somewhere the user actually is.
//
// Deliberately short, and skippable on the first screen. An onboarding nobody
// can escape is its own kind of disrespect, and the app is usable without any
// of this.
