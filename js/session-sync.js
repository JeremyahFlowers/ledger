// Moving session events between devices.
//
// Where this fits: above session-log.js, which owns what an event means, and
// below the workspace, which neither knows nor cares how an event arrived. This
// file is only transport.
//
// One interface, so that adding the fast channel later changes nothing here or
// above:
//
//   publish(event)        send it, eventually or immediately
//   subscribe(handler)    called with each event that arrives; returns unsubscribe
//   status                "connected" | "connecting" | "offline"
//   stop()
//
// This file implements the durable one: your own repo, at a coarse cadence. It
// is what makes handoff work — draw on the tablet, open the laptop, the drawing
// is there. It is not and cannot be the live one: a git commit takes a second or
// two and the rate limit is real, so a stroke-by-stroke cadence would flood the
// history and still not feel live.
//
// See docs/realtime-architecture.md. The design said session logs should live on
// a separate branch to keep `main` a record of releases; that was written
// thinking of the app repo. They go to the *data* repo, whose history is already
// a log of practice ("Ledger: session pattern-recall answer"), so a branch buys
// nothing and costs the Git refs API.
