//
// Where this fits: pure, below everything, no I/O and no DOM. The transports in
// session-sync.js move these events around; this file decides what an event is
// and what a log means. Keeping the two apart is the whole point — a durable
// channel and a live one carry identical events, and neither needs to know the
// other exists.
//
// See docs/realtime-architecture.md for why it is a log and not a series of
// state snapshots. Briefly: two transports with different latencies cannot
// share snapshots without one of them arriving carrying an older whole-world
// and overwriting the other's work. With identified events there is nothing to
// overwrite, and applying one twice is a no-op — which is what makes it safe to
// run both at once.
