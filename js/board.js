// What is on a whiteboard, and where — with no canvas in sight.

// freehand strokes: hit-testing, elementBounds and coordinate maths are exactly
// the kind of thing that is miserable to debug through a canvas and trivial to
// test on its own.
//
// Three decisions shape everything here.
//
// **Coordinates are logical, not pixels.** The original board stored points in
// device pixels of whatever canvas drew them, which is fine until the same
// drawing opens somewhere else: a diagram made on a retina tablet rendered at
// half scale on a laptop, and a pane dragged narrower squashed everything in
// it. Elements are stored in a space that is BOARD_WIDTH units across, and the
// canvas maps that to its own size on the way in and out. Nothing stored knows
// how big any screen is, or where the view happens to be panned to.
//
// **Everything is an element.** A freehand stroke, an arrow, a paragraph and an
// array diagram are the same kind of thing with different `kind`s, so undo,
// selection, moving, resizing, deletion, serialization and sync each have one
// implementation rather than one per tool.
//
// **Everything is a box.** Every element reports elementBounds, and resizing is
// one operation — map the points from the old box into the new one — rather
// than a rule per shape. Text became a box for this reason: as a bare anchor
// point it could not be resized, wrapped, or clicked accurately, and it was the
