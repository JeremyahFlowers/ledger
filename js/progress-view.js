// The Progress view: "am I actually getting better?"
//
// Where this fits: its own page under Track. The app already recorded
// everything needed to answer this, but spread across the queue, the quiz and
// the mastery table, so the answer was never actually on screen.
//
// Two decisions shape everything here.
//
// First, better does not mean more. The failure mode this whole app exists to
// prevent is grinding harder and calling it progress, so the headline measures
// are solving cleanly and recognizing the pattern faster. Volume appears only
// so that a spike followed by a collapse is visible for what it is, and a week
// far above the usual is named rather than congratulated.
//
// Second, the charts refuse to flatter. A week with a single attempt shows a
// gap rather than 0% or 100%, empty weeks stay visible instead of being
// collapsed, and a pattern without enough attempts on both sides of a split is
// left out rather than drawn as flat. A chart that misleads is worse than no
// chart, because it gets believed.
