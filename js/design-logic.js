// The system-design half of the domain: how a design session is timeboxed, how
// mastery of a component is measured, and how the two halves share one day.
//
// Where this fits: beside logic.js, which owns the coding half, and importing
// from it rather than duplicating. Spaced repetition, box intervals and the
// budget are the same machinery — a design problem is a problem with a
// different practice format, not a different kind of thing.
//
// The framing this whole file follows, and the reason it is not a separate
// feature: a day is 75 minutes of practice, and system design is part of that
// day rather than something you do instead. For anyone aiming past junior, the
// two are assessed in the same loop and should be prepared in the same loop.

/**
 * How a design interview actually runs, in the order it runs.
 *
 * This is the order every published framework teaches and the order an
 * interviewer expects, and the order matters more than any one part: an API
 * designed before the entities exist has nothing to carry, and a diagram drawn
 * before the requirements are agreed is a drawing of the wrong system. The
 * session walks them one at a time and will not let the whole thing collapse
 * into "draw boxes for forty minutes", which is what a single open-ended
 * timebox becomes.
 *
 * Each stage is worked, then checked against the answer key before the next
 * one starts. Checking at the end instead — which is what this used to do —
 * finds out on minute forty that the requirements were wrong on minute four,
 * by which point everything built on them was wasted.
 *
 * `kind` is what the stage is worked *in*: a list you write, the board you
 * draw on, or a series of questions put to you. `share` is its slice of the
 * box. Entities is deliberately the shortest — naming the nouns is a two
 * minute job that people routinely spend ten on.
