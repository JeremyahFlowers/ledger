// The app's error surface: one place where anything that goes wrong becomes
// something the user can see.
//
// Where this fits: installed once from app.js at boot, before anything else
// runs. Everything else in the app either throws, rejects, or calls report()
// — none of them decide how a failure is presented.
//
// Why it exists. A session could not be saved, and the reason was not a crash:
// the save button refused, correctly, and said nothing. The user pressed a
// bright, live-looking control over and over with no output of any kind. That
// is the same shape as an exception nobody catches or a promise nobody
// handles — work is lost and the interface looks fine.
//
// So the rule here is that silence is the bug. A failure may be recoverable,
// expected, or the user's own fault, but it may never be invisible.
//
// Two levels, deliberately different:
//   notice   something expected didn't happen, and the user can fix it. A
//            toast; it fades.
//   fault    something broke that shouldn't have. A banner that stays until
//            dismissed, because a message you might have missed is no better
//            than no message.
