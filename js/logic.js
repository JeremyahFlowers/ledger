// The daily budget is a ceiling for the day. It said nothing about one problem,
// so a single medium could absorb the whole seventy-five minutes — which is not
// how the thing being practised works. An interview gives you forty-five
// minutes and takes the laptop away, and the skill being trained is partly
// deciding, inside that box, when to stop planning and start typing.
//
// So each difficulty gets its own box, and the box is divided into the phases
// the process actually has. The division is not proportional, because the real
// process is not: understanding the problem takes about five minutes whether
// it is easy or hard, and what scales with difficulty is how long you should
// be willing to spend planning before committing to code.
//
// These are guardrails and not gates. Nothing stops when a phase ends; the app
// says where you are and what the phase is for, and running over is reported
// rather than hidden — an app that quietly stops counting teaches the opposite
// of the lesson.
