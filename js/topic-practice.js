// Practising a pattern from its topic page, from the whole catalog.
//
// Where it fits: renderTopicDetail (views.js) draws a pattern's page and hands
// this module an empty host. This fills it with catalog problems for the
// pattern that are not already in your list, easiest first, each one a click
// from a timed session.
//
// Why it exists: the page's "practice ladder" listed only problems you had
// already logged, so nine of the twenty-three patterns had a page you could
// read and nothing you could do from it. "If there's topics / patterns that I
// can learn but can't practise, what's the point?" — the catalog has hundreds
// of problems for every one of them.
//
// Loaded on demand: the catalog is a few hundred kilobytes and is needed only
// once a topic page is open.
