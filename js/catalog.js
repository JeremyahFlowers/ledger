//
// Where this fits: the Analyze view uses it to turn a prediction into practice,
// and the Review Queue uses it to suggest fresh volume on a weak pattern.
//
// The entries are metadata only — title, number, difficulty, tags, URL. No
// problem statements: the catalog says a problem exists and what shape it is,
// and links out to LeetCode for the text itself. Pattern weights come from each
// problem's own LeetCode topic tags, so these are labels rather than
// predictions, and are exact wherever LeetCode tagged the problem.
