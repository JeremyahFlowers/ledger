// Which copy of the app this is, and what it is allowed to touch.
//
// Where this fits: below everything, imported by anything that stores or
// displays. It has no dependencies on purpose — a mistake here would be a
// mistake about which data the app is writing to, and that is not a thing to
// resolve through three other modules.
//
// Why this exists. There was one copy of Ledger, deployed straight to the URL
// its owner actually practises on, sharing one data file and one set of
// browser keys. So testing a change meant testing against real practice data,
// and a development build opened on the same machine read the same cached
// state — which is exactly how test data ends up in front of someone who is
// trying to use the thing.
//
// Three rules, and the order matters:
//
//  1. The channel comes from where the page is served, never from a build step
//     or a flag. There is no build step in this project and a flag is
//     something you forget to set.
//  2. Every stored key is namespaced by channel, so the two cannot see each
//     other's data even in the same browser. This includes the token: a dev
//     build must not silently inherit write access to the real log.
//  3. A non-stable channel says so on screen, always, unmissably. The failure
//     this exists to prevent is not knowing which one you are looking at.
